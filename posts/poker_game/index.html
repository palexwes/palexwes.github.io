<p>The parameters for the poker_game.py in our first week assignments it states the game, poker,
must be created with the ability to accept an argument representing the number of players involved
in the game, sort the cards, and be able to run while following the rules of the game.</p>

<p>Over the time given for the project I was able to create a game more similar to a game of blackjack
using this logic :</p>

<p>Begin the game by creating a car deck; I did this by setting the card values in a list as well as
their types, creating an empty array as well. Utilize nested for loops to create the card. This portion
of the code sets  the card types and values.</p>

<p>Next create a function that evaluates the value of the card. Use if else statements to investigate
the card’s characteristics and correctly setting the value of the card so that they having meaning that
 can be used in the playing of the blackjack game.</p>

<p>Now, two simple functions will be created that will be for a new card and also removing a card from
the deck.</p>

<p>Moving from that into the main drive area of the function which is the lengthiest bit of code that can
 be broken down into three sections which is created with a while loop that is stopped through a
 variable first created outside of the loop, but edited in the loop has a exit function by taking in
  the string ‘EXIT’. If the play again variable doesn’t equal ‘EXIT’ it will continue.</p>

<p>First the deck needed to be created so that the game can be ran through, setting the deck through
card creation and removal from the deck, values, and totals created earlier.</p>

<p>After this the hand of the dealer should be created to compare values which is set up through setting
 values.</p>

<p>The third part of the cod is the creation of the if else statements and along with a
while loop to run through the game with the inner while loop will stop when a total goes over
the value 21.  It uses if else statements through more card creation, removal, and value that was
added to the total. Along with more if else statements that entice inputs from the user while
checking that the rules of the game are being followed, with the ability for a hit or stay from the player.</p>

<p>The game eventually ends in which it prints a ‘Thanks for Playing’ to the user.</p>
